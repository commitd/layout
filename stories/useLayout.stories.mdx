# `useLayout`

If you need to adjust any of your own layout according to the properties of the current committed layout you can use the
`useLayout()` react hook to obtain all the details of the current (size dependent) layout.

This is particularly useful for children of layout components.

The returned object is of the form:

```typescript
export interface Layout {
  /**
   * Is the navigation panel currently open
   */
  open: boolean
  /**
   * Is the navigation currently collapsed
   */
  collapsed: boolean
  /**
   * Is the layout contained inside some other component.
   */
  contained: boolean
  /**
   * Is the layout currently being dragged.
   */
  dragged: boolean
  /**
   * In which breakpoint range is the screen currently
   */
  screen: Breakpoint
  /**
   * Function to control the collapsed state.
   * Set explicitly using a boolean or pass an object to toggle (this allow convenient use as a mouse event handler)
   */
  setCollapsed: (val: boolean | object) => void
  /**
   * Function to control the dragged state.
   */
  setDragged: (val: boolean) => void
  /**
   * Function to control the open state.
   * Set explicitly using a boolean or pass an object to toggle (this allow convenient use as a mouse event handler)
   */
  setOpen: (val: boolean | object) => void
  /**
   * Function to control the nav width.
   */
  setNavWidth: (val: number) => void

  // The below is the LayoutConfig for the current screen size

  /**
   * Can the navigation be collapsed to a smaller form
   * @default true
   */
  collapsible: boolean
  /**
   * Width of the collapsed navigation (px)
   * @default 64
   */
  collapsedWidth: number
  /**
   * Is the layout navbar draggable.

   * @default left
   */
