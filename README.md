This is a simple layout for standard looking material based apps, based on [Mui Layout](https://mui-treasury.com/components/layout)
but using `@commitd/components` as its base.

## Install

For use with `@commitd/components`,

```bash
yarn add @commitd/layout
```

## Usage

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@commitd/components'
import { Root, Header, Nav, Content, Footer } from '@commitd/layout'

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Root style={{ minHeight: '100vh' }} config={{
       // adjust behavior here!
       // See LayoutConfig
    }}>
      <Header>Header</Header>
      <Nav
        header={
          // you can provide fixed header inside nav
          // change null to some react element
          ctx => null
        }
      >
        Nav
      </Nav>
      <Content>Content</Content>
      <Footer>Footer</Footer>
    </Root>
  </ThemeProvider>
)

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
```


## Config

For each config parameter a single value or an object with breakpoint keys can be supplied, e.g.

```
const config = {
   navWidth: {
      // xs is 256px by default
      sm: 200, // in sm
      md: 256, // mdUp
    }
}
```
